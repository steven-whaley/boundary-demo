# Boundary Demo

## Demo Environment
This terraform code builds an HCP Boundary enviroment that inclues connectivity to HCP Vault for credential brokering and injection, Okta integration for OIDC authentication and managed groups, and a number of AWS resources that are used as workers and Boundary targets.

| HCP Boundary | Boundary Control Plane |
| HCP Vault | Boundary Credential Store |
| Boundary Worker | Boundary EC2 Worker |
| Okta | OIDC Authentication |

| RDS Postgres Database | Database Target |
| EC2 Windows Instance | RDP Target |
| EC2 Bastion Host | For Troubleshooting |

## Setup
### Workspaces and Variables
This repo was built to run on Terraform Cloud or Enterprise.  It uses the tfe_outputs data source to pass parameters from the init module to the build module.  If you want to run this locally you will need to modify the code to use cross state sharing to populate those values.  Additionally, you will need to update or remote the cloud provider block to match your Terraform configuration. 

This repo consists of two modules:
 
**boundary-demo-init** - This module builds an HCP Boundary Cluster and HCP Vault Cluster along with an associated HVN for the Vault Cluster.  
**boundary-demo-eks** - This module does the bulk of the work, building out all of the Boundary and Vault configuration as well as the AWS components used as workers and targets.

#### boundary-demo-init
| Variable | Type | Purpose |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| boundary_user | terraform | The user name you would like to use for the default admin user created in the HCP Boundary Cluster |
| boundary_password | terraform | The password you would like to use for the default admin user created in the HCP Boundary Cluster |
| hcp_client_id | terraform | The Client ID used to authenticate to HCP |
| hcp_client_secret | terraform | The Secret Key used to authenticate to HCP |
| tfc_org | terraform | Terraform Cloud Organization name |
| workspace_name | terraform | Terraform Cloud Workspace name (i.e. boundary-demo-init)|

#### boundary-demo-eks
| Variable | Type | Purpose |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| region | terraform | The AWS region to deploy worker and targets into (us-west-2 used in the demo-init)|
| tfc_org | terraform | Terraform Cloud Organization name |
| init_workspace_name | terraform | Terraform Cloud Workspace name used for the initial resources (i.e. boundary-demo-init)|
| boundary_user | terraform | The Boundary admin user that will be set in the provider | 
| boundary_password | terraform | The Boundary admin user password that will be set in the provider |
| db_user | terraform | The username to set on the Postgres database Boundary target |
| db_password | terraform | The password to set on the Postgres database Boundary target |
| okta_baseurl | terraform | The base url for the Okta organization used for OIDC integration.  Probably okta.com |
| okta_org_name | terraform | The organization name for the Okta organization use for OIDC integration i.e. dev-32201783 |
| hcp_client_id | terraform | The Client ID used to authenticate to HCP |
| hcp_client_secret | terraform | The Secret Key used to authenticate to HCP |
| OKTA_API_TOKEN | environment | The token used to authenticate the Okta provider |
| TFE_TOKEN | environment | The token used to authenticate the Terraform provider to use the tfe_outputs data source |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | environment | The AWS Access Key used to authenticate the AWS provider |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | environment | The AWS Secret Key used to authenticate the AWS provider |

**Notes**
- If you do not wish to use the Okta integration you can simply rename or delete the okta.tf configuration file.  All of the Okta related configuration is contained within the file and the terraform code should still build cleanly without it.  
- The Okta group_ids that are mapped to the Okta app we create are currently hard coded so you will need to change those in the okta.tf file for the okta_app_group_assignment resources.  I will look at turning this into a datasource or at least variables in the future.  
- The Dynamic Host Set setup uses an IAM role and User configuration that is specific to Hashicorp Employee AWS sandbox accounts.  If used in account without restrictions on the ability to create IAM users and policies then you will want to modify the configuration at the top of the boundary.tf config file to create the required IAM user and policy directly.  

### To Build
Set the variables to appropriate values and update the cloud block in the providers.tf files in each module as appropriate.  
Init and apply the boundary-demo-init terraform first

`boundary-demo-init % terraform init`

`boundary-demo-init % terraform apply -auto-approve`

Once the boundary-demo-init run has completed init and apply the boundary-demo-eks terraform

`boundary-demo-eks % terraform init`

`boundary-demo-eks % terraform apply -auto-approve`

**Notes**: 
- The terraform code is generally stable and completes in a single run but if you experience issues a second run is usually enough to correct them.  
- If for some reason you need to rebuild the EC2 Boundary worker you should also taint the boundary_worker resource as rebuilding the EC2 instance without re-creating the worker in Boundary and getting a new auth key will cause the worker to fail to connect to the Boundary control plane.  

## Connecting to Targets
If you are using the Okta integration then:
- Members of the dev_users group in Okta have permissions to connect to the targets in the dev_w2_project scope
- Members of the pie_users group in Okta have permissions to connect to the targets in the pie_w2_project scope
- Members of the it_users group in Okta have permissions to connect to the targets in the it_w2_project scope

### Connect to the SSH certificate target
`boundary connect ssh -target-scope-name pie_w2_project -target-name pie-ssh-cert-target`

### Connecting to SSH TCP taget with brokered credentials for some admin user configured on the server
`boundary connect ssh -target-scope-name pie_w2_project -target-name pie-ssh-tcp-target -- -l ec2-user`

### Connect to the K8s target
You will still need credentials to connect to the EKS cluster via K8s, which you can get via the AWS CLI.  Be sure to set the appropriate region where you deployed your AWS resources.

`aws eks update-kubeconfig --name boundary-demo-cluster --region $AWS_REGION`

`boundary connect kube -target-scope-name pie_w2_project -target-name pie-k8s-target -- get pods`

### Connect to the Postgres database target
`boundary connect postgres -target-scope-name dev_w2_project -target-name dev-db-target -dbname postgres`

### Connect to the RDP target (Administrator Credentials can be retrieved through the AWS Console)
`boundary connect rdp -exec bash -target-scope-name it_w2_project -target-name it-rdp-target -- -c "open rdp://full%20address=s={{boundary.addr}} && sleep 600"`
